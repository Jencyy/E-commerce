# 🛒 My E-Commerce React Project

This project is a full-fledged e-commerce application built with React, using the `useContext` hook extensively. The application features a unified user and admin interface, authentication via Firebase, and essential e-commerce functionalities such as product filtering and an "Add to Cart" feature.

## ✨ Features

- **👥 User and Admin Roles:** The application distinguishes between user and admin roles. The admin interface is accessible only by logging in with a specific account.
- **🔐 Authentication:** Users must sign up and log in to interact with the application, with authentication managed by Firebase.
- **🛍️ Product Listing:** Products are displayed with filtering options based on categories and prices.
- **🛒 Add to Cart:** Users can add products to their cart, with the cart data stored locally.
- **📱 Responsive Design:** The UI is responsive and adjusts seamlessly across various screen sizes.
- **🔥 Firebase Integration:** Firebase is used for backend services, including user authentication.

## 🔑 Admin Access

To access the admin interface, use the following credentials:

- **Email:** `jenu@gmail.com`
- **Password:** `121212`

Logging in with this account grants access to the application's administrative features. Other accounts will be restricted to the user interface.

## 🛠️ Installation

### Firebase Configuration

This project uses Firebase for authentication and other backend services. You'll need to set up your Firebase project and configure it in your React application.

- Go to the Firebase Console and create a new project.
- Create a Firebase app and add your project's Firebase configuration to your React project.
- Replace the Firebase configuration in your project with your own. This configuration is typically found in a file like `firebaseConfig.js` or within your main application file.

## 🚀 Running the Application

Once everything is set up, you can start the application with:

```bash
npm run dev
```
This will start the development server, and you can view the application in your browser at http://localhost:5173.
